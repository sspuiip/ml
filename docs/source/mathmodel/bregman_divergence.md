# Bregman divergence

The surprising result - due to [Banerjee, Gou, and Wang 2005](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1459065) is the following,

> If you have some abstract way of measuring the "distance" between any two points and, for any choice of distribution over points the mean point minimises the average distance to all the others, then your distance measure must be a Bregman divergence.
